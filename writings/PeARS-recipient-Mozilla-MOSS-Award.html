  <h1 class="PageTitle">PeARS recipient <br/>Mozilla MOSS Award</h1>

  <p>PeARS team is very excited to have been chosen as one of eight recipients of a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/06/22/mozilla-awards-385000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss-mission-partners-program/" target="_blank" title="link to Mozilla's MOSS Award page. The link opens on a new tab"> MOSS "mission partners" award</a>. We congratulate the other grantees who all have exciting projects, from anonymity preservation to game engines and screen readers for the visually impaired!</p>

  <p>What does the award mean for PeARS? We received a generous award of $15,500, which will allow us to do the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rent some Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for development and testing.</li>
    <li>Provide financial support for one team member working full-time on our Distributed Hash Table for 3 months.</li>
    <li>Organise a one-week team meeting/public workshop in India in 2017. </li>
    <li>Contract a professional graphics designer to work on the project's user interface and online material.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We invite everybody to check out the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" target="_blank" title="link to Mozilla Manifesto page. The link opens on a new tab"> Mozilla manifesto</a>. PeARS wholeheartedly supports the initiative and hope to contribute to the MOSS community in several ways:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>We want to give a proof-of-concept that Internet search can be a free and open technology, ensuring that each individual can shape it according to their needs, without meddling from business and political interests. Web search is often regarded as a complex and expensive 'big data' application, the design and running of which we must leave to large corporations. PeARS aims at breaking down this myth by building a distributed search application that can run on a home laptop, and will be configurable by users.
    </li>
    <li>We want to concretely demonstrate that decentralisation can replace big data applications currently running on huge server farms, thus encouraging public participation in re-shaping Internet search.</li>
    <li>We want to make individuals aware of their privacy choices on the Internet by giving them a tool to privately process their browsing history and consciously decide what to share of their personal information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Like our goals? Then come and chat to us. You can contribute too!</p>
